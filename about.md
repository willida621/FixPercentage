# FixPercentage

This mod improves the accuracy of the progress percentage display when playing from a start position. It calculates the correct percentage based on your position relative to the entire level, rather than just the portion after the start position.

# This is particularly useful for:
- Creators testing specific parts of their level
- Players practicing difficult sections
- Anyone who wants accurate progress information when using start positions
